44.8 (Garbage Collection)

"For example, 2000 and 2001 clearly are still pointed to by the map; 
100 and 101 are not and
therefore are candidates for garbage collection."

->

"For example, pages 2 and 3 clearly are still pointed to by the map (by logical blocks
2000 and 2001, respectively); 0 and 1
are no longer pointed to by anything and are therefore candidates for garbage collection."
